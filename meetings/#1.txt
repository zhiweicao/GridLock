Meeting on codeshare.io [https://codeshare.io/24p70d] and Discord - 14/4

who are the intended users: are they novice, intermediate or expert, 
or all sorts of users (do we even understand what this means?)
- difficulty suits all users
- game will be playable as easy, normal, hard
- do this by:
	- less/more cars
  - moving cars
  - size of board
  - limit moves
  	- < 10 moves - gold star
    - < 20 moves - silver
    - < 30 moves - bronze


what sort of features are basic to the application (i.e. needed by every user)?
- UI design
	- menu
  - move counter
  - undo
  - reset
  - difficulty
  - "nice" sprites i.e. cars etc
	- next level/ restart level button
- "random" algorithm to produce map
- tutorial


what sort of features are needed by different categories of users: 
how can the interface handle seemingly different requirements?
- move counter
	- easy: no counter
  - normal: counter + time counter
  - hard: 
  	- time attack
    - optimal -> less than (optimal path + 5)
- hints for different levels
- puzzle complexity (size etc)


what sort of help or hints (if any) should the system be able to 
provide to users (and how and when is this help given)?
- log moves from solving algo, or solve from where the cars are
- use this to provide hints on next move
- no hints on advanced levels
- penalties for hints on normal + advanced
- max hints?
- colorblind - accessibility


what platforms with what form factors is the system designed to run on?
- java
- test on linux, mac, windows,
