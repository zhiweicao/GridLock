Model


IN VIEW

Listens for input
I got an input
Input is legitimate and has changed from the last input
is this a win state?
model.win?
else 
model.updateModel(information from input)

I receive a new model/redraw request
I redraw


undo button




In MODEL(BOARD)

okay I have information to change the gamestate
now I update the gamestate
i update the counter
i update past game states
Now I tell the view to redraw the new gamestate


i want to undo:
view.updateScreen call

view.updateScreen(new gamestate information)
- why would i use this?
- undo move
- redo move

view.monitorWin
- does the received state from view match our win state
